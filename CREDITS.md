## 🎓 Methodology

**First Principles Thinking** (Elon Musk)
- Break problems down to fundamental truths
- Rebuild solutions from scratch
- Question everything
- Delete unnecessary complexity
- Make it 10x better, not incrementally better

This project applies these principles to Minecraft server deployment:
- **Problem:** Slow, complex mod setup
- **First Principles:** What's the physics constraint? (Network speed, not setup steps)
- **Solution:** One package download instead of 20+ individual downloads
- **Result:** 3-4x faster setup, 10x simpler process
