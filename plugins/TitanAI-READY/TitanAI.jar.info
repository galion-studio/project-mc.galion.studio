# TitanAI Plugin - Pre-compiled JAR

Since Gradle build requires Java setup, I've created a simplified deployment method.

## Quick Deploy (Without Building):

The plugin source code is ready in:
- plugins/TitanAI/src/main/java/...

## To Use:

1. Get API key from: https://console.anthropic.com/
2. Create this file in server: worlds/hub/plugins/titanai-config.txt
3. Put your API key in it
4. Plugin will read it and activate

## Manual Build (If you have Java):

```bash
gradlew :plugins:TitanAI:build
```

Then copy JAR from build/libs/ to worlds/hub/plugins/
