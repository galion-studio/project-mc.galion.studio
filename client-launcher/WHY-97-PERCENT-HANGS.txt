  WHY DOES THE DOWNLOAD HANG AT 97%?
================================================================

IT'S NOT STUCK! It's still downloading! Here's what's happening:

DOWNLOAD PHASES:
----------------
1. 0-50%:   Downloading libraries (~87 files) - FAST
2. 50-95%:  Downloading main game JAR - FAST  
3. 95-100%: Downloading ASSETS - SLOW! ⚠️

WHAT ARE ASSETS?
----------------
Assets = thousands of tiny files:
- All sound effects (footsteps, blocks, music)
- All textures (every block, item, entity)
- All language files
- Font files
- Shader files

Total: 5000-7000+ tiny files!

WHY IS IT SLOW?
----------------
- Each file needs a separate HTTP request
- Server limits how fast you can request
- Your antivirus might scan each file
- Network overhead for each tiny file

TYPICAL TIMES:
--------------
0-97%:     2-3 minutes ✅ FAST
97-100%:   3-5 minutes ⏱️ SLOW (but working!)

Total:     5-8 minutes for first download

HOW TO KNOW IT'S WORKING:
--------------------------
- Progress text says "Downloading thousands of small files"
- File count keeps increasing
- Hard drive light is active
- Network activity in task manager

IT WILL FINISH! Just be patient! ☕
