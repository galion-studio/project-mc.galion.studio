# 🌟 GALION.STUDIO - TRUE OPEN SOURCE PHILOSOPHY

## Everyone Gets Admin Powers!

At Galion Studio, we believe in **true freedom** through open source.

---

## 🔓 WHAT THIS MEANS

### Default Account: `galion.studio`
- **Full Admin Permissions** by default
- **No restrictions** on commands
- **Complete creative freedom**
- **No gatekeeping** - everyone is trusted

### Why?

**Because open source isn't just about code - it's about FREEDOM.**

- No paywalls
- No permission barriers  
- No "premium" tiers
- No artificial limitations

**Everyone who joins gets the same power as the server owner.**

---

## 💪 ADMIN POWERS YOU GET

When you connect as `galion.studio` (or any username), you have:

✅ **All Commands** - /op, /gamemode, /give, everything  
✅ **World Edit** - Build anything  
✅ **Plugin Control** - Configure what you want  
✅ **Server Management** - Help manage the community  
✅ **Creative Freedom** - No limits on imagination

## 🌍 THE PHILOSOPHY

### Traditional Servers
```
Owner    → All power
Admins   → Some power
Mods     → Little power  
Players  → No power
```

### Galion Studio
```
EVERYONE → Full power
```

**Trust by default. Freedom first. Community managed.**

---

## 🤝 WITH GREAT POWER...

We trust you to:
- **Build amazing things**
- **Help others**
- **Be creative, not destructive**
- **Share knowledge**
- **Contribute to the community**

If someone abuses power:
- Community self-moderates
- Backups restore anything
- Open discussion, not bans
- Focus on education, not punishment

---

## 🎮 HOW IT WORKS

1. **Download launcher** - Open source, inspect the code
2. **Connect as `galion.studio`** - Or any name you want
3. **You have admin** - Full permissions from the start
4. **Build, create, experiment** - No limitations
5. **Help others** - Share your admin powers with knowledge

## 🔧 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Default Username: `galion.studio`
Set in launcher config:
```python
return "galion.studio"  # Open source = full admin access for all!
```

### Server Permissions

### Why This Works
