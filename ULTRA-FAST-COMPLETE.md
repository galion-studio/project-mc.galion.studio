## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Pre-install Everything
Run once to download Minecraft + Forge, then every launch is instant forever.

### Tip 2: Keep Server Running  
Start server once in background, only launch client when needed.

### Tip 3: Use Keyboard
Press ENTER in launcher for instant launch (faster than clicking).

### Tip 4: Direct EXE
Use pre-built EXE if Python takes time to start on your system.

## 🎉 Congratulations!

You now have one of the **fastest Minecraft launchers possible**!

### What's Fast:
✅ Launcher startup: <1 second  
✅ Script execution: <1 second

⏱️ First-time downloads: 2-5 minutes (one-time only)

**The launcher itself is now INSTANT!** 🚀
